## Project Topic:
Exploration of the Ocean

# Potential datasources:

# Visualization ideas:
1. Show map chart of ocean temperatures/tides/winds changing over time
2. Pollution 50 years ago vs now
3. Show how ocean temperatures/tides/winds have changed per year
4. Level of light in different depths of the ocean
5. Fish population 50 years ago vs now - migration pattern
